# Web Crawler Project

This project is a simple web crawler designed to scrape web pages and extract information. The main focus of the crawler is to demonstrate basic web scraping capabilities using Python.

## Project Structure

- **Class/Crawler.py**: Contains the `Crawler` class responsible for fetching and parsing web pages.
- **main.py**: The main entry point of the project which creates an instance of the `Crawler` class and performs web crawling on a specified URL.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-crawler.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd web-crawler
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Test

You can test the crawler by running the `Crawler.py` file directly:

```bash
python Class/Crawler.py
```

This will crawl the [Dota 2 Wiki](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Dota_2_Wiki) and print the title of the page.

### Running the Main Script

To use the crawler with a different URL, you can modify the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will create an instance of the `Crawler` class and perform web crawling on the specified URL in `main.py`.

## Example

Here's a quick example of what you might see when running the test:

```plaintext
Crawling successful. Here is the title of the page:
Dota 2 Wiki
```
